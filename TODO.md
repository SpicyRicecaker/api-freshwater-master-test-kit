- [x] place buttons below text
- features
    - [ ] add an undo button (to the panel as a whole.)

        - wonder what pattern supports undos the best.
    - [ ] implement a way to test components of the leptos app
    - [ ] make program usable on mobile phone (as not many people pull out an ipad or computer when testing aquarium water.)
    - [ ] distinguish between separate tasks more clearly.
- bugs
    - [ ] gray out and make previous next buttons unable to be clicked upon completing the task
